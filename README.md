Building iOS and Android apps can be prohibitively expensive for a startup. Because of this we can use the Flutter SDK to create iOS and Android apps in just one coding session (saving on costs and time). In this class, we will learn together from the basics to build applications that help people find boarding houses around the world. This application is also integrated with the API to store important data such as boarding info, and others.

If you are currently learning Flutter from scratch, then this class is perfect because we will also learn about how to implement designs in Figma into code using the Flutter SDK and Visual Studio Code and Dart. Please join and we will be waiting in class.
